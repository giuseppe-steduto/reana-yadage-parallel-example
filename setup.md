### REANA client

This lesson teaches the principles of containerised scientific workflows by means of using the
[REANA](http://www.reana.io/) reproducible analysis platform.

The participants should either install [reana-client](https://pypi.org/project/reana-client/) on
their laptops:

~~~bash
virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/reana
source ~/.virtualenvs/reana/bin/activate
pip install reana-client
~~~
{: .source}

Alternatively, the participants can log into CERN's LXPLUS cluster using `ssh lxplus.cern.ch` and
activate a pre-existing environment there:

~~~bash
source /afs/cern.ch/user/r/reana/public/reana/bin/activate
~~~
{: .source}

After installation of `reana-client`, please check whether the client works by asking for its
version:

~~~bash
reana-client version
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
0.9.1
~~~
{: .output}
