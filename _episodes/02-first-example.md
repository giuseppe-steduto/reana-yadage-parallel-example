## Overview

In this lesson we shall run our first simple REANA example. We shall see:

- structure of the example analysis and associated ``reana.yaml`` file
- how to install of REANA command-line client
- how to connect REANA client to remote REANA cluster
- how to run analysis on remote REANA cluster

## First REANA example

We shall get acquainted with REANA by means of running a sample analysis example:

- [reana-demo-root6-roofit](https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-root6-roofit)

Let's start by cloning it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-root6-roofit
cd reana-demo-root6-roofit
```
{: .source}

What does the example do? The example emulates a typical particle physics analysis where the signal
and background data is processed and fitted against a model. The example uses the
[RooFit](https://root.cern/manual/roofit/) package of the [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) framework.

Four questions:

1. **Where is your input data?** There is no input data. We shall simulate them.
2. **Where is your analysis code?** Two files: ``gendata.C`` macro generates signal and background data; ``fitdata.C`` macro makes a fit for the signal and the background data.
3. **Which computing environment do you use?** ROOT 6.18.04 with RooFit.
4. **What are the computational steps to achieve the results?** Simple sequential steps: first run gendata, then run fitdata.

Workflow definition:

```
           START
            |
            |
            V
+-------------------------+
| (1) generate data       |
|                         |
|    $ root gendata.C ... |
+-------------------------+
            |
            | data.root
            V
+-------------------------+
| (2) fit data            |
|                         |
|    $ root fitdata.C ... |
+-------------------------+
            |
            | plot.png
            V
           STOP
```
{: .output}

The four questions expressed in ``reana.yaml`` fully define our analysis:

```yaml
inputs:
  files:
    - code/gendata.C
    - code/fitdata.C
  parameters:
    events: 20000
    data: results/data.root
    plot: results/plot.png
workflow:
  type: serial
  specification:
    steps:
      - name: gendata
        environment: 'docker.io/reanahub/reana-env-root6:6.18.04'
        commands:
        - mkdir -p results && root -b -q 'code/gendata.C(${events},"${data}")'
      - name: fitdata
        environment: 'docker.io/reanahub/reana-env-root6:6.18.04'
        commands:
        - root -b -q 'code/fitdata.C("${data}","${plot}")'
outputs:
  files:
    - results/plot.png
```
{: .source}

Note the basic structure of `reana.yaml` answering the Four Questions. (Where is input data? Where
is analysis code? What compute environment to use? What are the computational steps to arrive at
results?)

## First steps with the REANA command-line client

First we need to make sure we can use REANA command-line client. See the [setup instructions](../setup) if
you haven't already installed it.

The client will offer several commands which we shall go through in this tutorial:

```bash
reana-client --help
```
{: .source}

```
Usage: reana-client [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  REANA client for interacting with REANA server.

Options:
  -l, --loglevel [DEBUG|INFO|WARNING]
                                  Sets log level
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Quota commands:
  quota-show  Show user quota.

Configuration commands:
  info     List cluster general information.
  ping     Check connection to REANA server.
  version  Show version.

Workflow management commands:

```
{: .output}

You can use ``--help`` option to learn more about any command, for example ``validate``:

```bash
reana-client validate --help
```
{: .source}

```
Usage: reana-client validate [OPTIONS]

  Validate workflow specification file.

  The ``validate`` command allows to check syntax and validate the reana.yaml
  workflow specification file.

  Examples:

       $ reana-client validate -f reana.yaml

Options:
  -f, --file PATH          REANA specification file describing the workflow to
                           execute. [default=reana.yaml]
  --environments           If set, check all runtime environments specified in
                           REANA specification file. [default=False]
  --pull                   If set, try to pull remote environment image from
                           registry to perform validation locally. Requires
                           ``--environments`` flag. [default=False]
  --server-capabilities    If set, check the server capabilities such as
                           workspace validation. [default=False]
  -t, --access-token TEXT  Access token of the current user.
  --help                   Show this message and exit.
```

## Connect REANA client to remote REANA cluster

The REANA client will interact with a remote REANA cluster. It knows to which REANA cluster it
connects by means of the following environment variable:

```bash
export REANA_SERVER_URL=https://reana.cern.ch
```
{: .source}

In order to authenticate to REANA, you need to generate a token.

> ## Exercise: Obtain a token.
>In order to obtain your token, please go to https://reana.cern.ch and ask for it.
{: .challenge}

In your terminal, paste the line with your new access token as seen below.

```bash
export REANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxx
```
{: .source}

It may be a good idea to create a `reana-setup-environment.sh` file to store these two export
commands. That way you all you need to do to setup your environment is `source
reana-setup-environment.sh`. An alternative to this is opening up your `.bashrc` file and pasting
the above two export commands there.

The REANA client connection to remote REANA cluster can be verified via ``ping`` command:

```bash
reana-client ping
```
{: .source}

```
REANA server: https://reana.cern.ch
REANA server version: 0.9.1
REANA client version: 0.9.1
Authenticated as: John Doe <john.doe@example.org>
Status: Connected
```
{: .output}

## Run example on REANA cluster

Now that we have defined and validated our ``reana.yaml``, and connected to the REANA production
cluster, we can run the example easily via:

```bash
reana-client run -w roofit
```
{: .source}

```
==> Creating a workflow...
==> Verifying REANA specification file... reana.yaml
  -> SUCCESS: Valid REANA specification file.
==> Verifying REANA specification parameters...
  -> SUCCESS: REANA specification parameters appear valid.
==> Verifying workflow parameters and commands...
  -> SUCCESS: Workflow parameters and commands appear valid.
==> Verifying dangerous workflow operations...
  -> SUCCESS: Workflow operations appear valid.
==> Verifying compute backends in REANA specification file...
  -> SUCCESS: Workflow compute backends appear to be valid.
roofit.1
==> SUCCESS: File /reana.yaml was successfully uploaded.
==> Uploading files...
==> Detected .gitignore file. Some files might get ignored.
==> SUCCESS: File /code/gendata.C was successfully uploaded.
==> SUCCESS: File /code/fitdata.C was successfully uploaded.
==> Starting workflow...
==> SUCCESS: roofit.1 is pending
```
{: .output}

Here, we use ``run`` command that will create a new workflow named ``roofit``, upload its inputs as
specified in the workflow specification and finally start the workflow.

While the workflow is running, we can enquire about its status:

```bash
reana-client status -w roofit
```
{: .source}

```
NAME     RUN_NUMBER   CREATED               STARTED               STATUS    PROGRESS
roofit   1            2020-02-17T16:01:45   2020-02-17T16:01:48   running   1/2
```
{: .output}

After a minute or so, the workflow should finish:

```bash
reana-client status -w roofit
```
{: .source}

```
NAME     RUN_NUMBER   CREATED               STARTED               ENDED                 STATUS     PROGRESS
roofit   1            2020-02-17T16:01:45   2020-02-17T16:01:48   2020-02-17T16:02:44   finished   2/2

```
{: .output}

We can list the output files in the remote workspace:

```bash
reana-client ls -w roofit
```
{: .source}

```

results/data.root   154457   2020-02-17T16:02:17
```
{: .output}

We can also inspect the logs:

```bash
reana-client logs -w roofit | less
# (Hit q to quit 'less')
```
{: .source}

```
